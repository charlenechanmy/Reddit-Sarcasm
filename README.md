# Reddit Sarcasm

## 1. Project Description
This project is to develop a solution for identifying sarcastic comments on Reddit using supervised learning techniques. Detecting sarcasm can help Redditors interpret comments in the intended humorous or satirical context, promoting clearer communication and reducing potential misunderstandings and conflicts.

## 2. Objectives
1. Perform various data processing steps on textual data
2. Build models to predict likelihood of comment being sarcastic
3. Compare models and choose the best model
